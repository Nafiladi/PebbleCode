# 🪨 PubbleCode

**PubbleCode** is a beginner-friendly programming language IDE and code editor that I personally built as my **first complete project** using **C# and WinUI 3**.

This small, self contained environment allows users to write and run simple, readable code designed specifically to help **children and beginners** explore coding in a fun, safe, and approachable way.

# 🎯 Introduction & Purpose

I created PubbleCode with a simple goal:

> 🗨️ *"To help children and beginners learn to code in a fun, safe, and easy-to-understand way."*

Whether you're:

* 👨‍🏫 An educator introducing coding in the classroom
* 👨‍👩‍👧 A parent encouraging creative learning at home
* 👦 A young coder eager to build your first program

**PubbleCode** offers a clean and playful way to begin your coding journey.



# 🔓 Open for All – Modify, Share, Use Freely!

You're welcome to:

* 🧠 Study how PubbleCode works
* 🛠️ Modify or improve the code
* 🚀 Use it in your own apps — even for commercial projects

> ✅ No permission required
> ✅ No fees
> ✅ Licensed for full freedom (MIT License)

# 💻 Requirements

To build or run PebbleCode, you’ll need:

* **Windows 10/11**
* **.NET 6 SDK**
* **Visual Studio 2022 or newer**, with the following workloads:

  * ✅ **.NET Desktop Development**
  * ✅ **WinUI 3 / Windows App SDK**


# 🔐 Assembly Note: Fill in Your Own PublicKeyToken

If you're modifying this project or creating your own version of PebbleCode, you may need to supply your **own PublicKeyToken** in the `app.manifest` when referencing Microsoft-signed libraries (such as **WinUI 3**).

This is only relevant if you:

* Resign assemblies
* Package the app for store publishing or secure enterprise use

For development and personal use, this step is often unnecessary.


# 🛠️ Building the Project

To get started:

```
git clone https://github.com/Nafiladi/PubbleCode.git
```

Then:

1. Open `PubbleCode.sln` in **Visual Studio**
2. Build the solution
3. Press **F5** to run
